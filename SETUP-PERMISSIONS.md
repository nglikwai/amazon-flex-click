   - Click the "Privacy" tab at the top

4. **Select Accessibility**
   - In the left sidebar, scroll down and click "Accessibility"

5. **Unlock Settings**
   - Click the lock icon in the bottom left
   - Enter your admin password

6. **Add Your Terminal**
   - Click the "+" button below the app list
   - Navigate to and select your terminal app:
     - **Terminal**: `/Applications/Utilities/Terminal.app`
     - **iTerm2**: `/Applications/iTerm.app`
     - **VS Code**: `/Applications/Visual Studio Code.app` (if running from VS Code terminal)

7. **Enable the App**
   - Make sure the checkbox next to your terminal app is checked ‚úÖ

### Method 2: System Settings (macOS Ventura and later)

## Alternative: Grant Permission When Prompted

When you first run the app, macOS may show a dialog asking for permission:

1. **Click "Open System Preferences"** in the dialog
2. **Follow steps 4-7** from Method 1 above
3. **Return to terminal** and run the app again

## Verify Permissions

To test if permissions are working:

```bash
npm run setup
```

If you can move your mouse and the app detects the position, permissions are working correctly.

## Troubleshooting

### Permission Denied Error
```
Error: Permission denied
```
- Make sure you added the correct terminal app
- Restart your terminal after granting permissions
- Try running with `sudo` (not recommended for security)

### App Not Clicking
- Verify the terminal app is listed in Accessibility settings
- Make sure the checkbox/toggle is enabled
- Close and reopen your terminal
- Try running the setup tool to test mouse control

### Can't Find Terminal App
Common terminal application paths:
- **Terminal**: `/Applications/Utilities/Terminal.app`
- **iTerm2**: `/Applications/iTerm.app`
- **Hyper**: `/Applications/Hyper.app`
- **Alacritty**: `/Applications/Alacritty.app`
- **VS Code**: `/Applications/Visual Studio Code.app`

### Still Having Issues?

1. **Restart your computer** after granting permissions
2. **Check Console.app** for error messages
3. **Try a different terminal** application
4. **Run as administrator** (security risk - not recommended)
